# Music Recommendation System

This project focuses on developing a Music Recommendation System using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Means clustering method to predict user preferences.

## Introduction

This Music Recommendation System aims to enhance the way users discover new music by predicting their preferences based on clusters of similar songs. The system utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to group tracks and recommend music that aligns with their tastes.

## Features

- Aggregated and cleaned vast amounts of music-related data.
- Utilized K-Means clustering method to predict user preferences based on similarity clusters.
- Fine-tuned the model to achieve a high silhouette score, ensuring well-defined and meaningful clusters.
- Built a website for user experience where users can select their favorite song and receive 5 similar recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is Spotify dataset. Details about the dataset sources, structure, and preprocessing steps can be found in the notebook directory.

## Model Development

The model is developed using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Here's a brief overview of the process:

- Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training using K-Means
- Model Evaluation & Optimization

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing user experiences through personalized music recommendations. By leveraging the K-Means clustering algorithm and fine-tuning the model for high silhouette scores, we have created a system that can effectively predict user preferences and recommend similar songs. The deployment of a user-friendly website further enhances the accessibility and usability of the recommendation system. We look forward to exploring more applications of machine learning in the future and continuously improving this system based on user feedback and new advancements in the field.
